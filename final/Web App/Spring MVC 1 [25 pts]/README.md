Description:
Attached is a zip archive containing the source code of a Spring MVC Java web application. Download and extract the archive.

The goal is for you to analyze the code and construct HTTP requests to either **(There are multiple sites due to high traffic volume)**:

- http://challenges.ctfd.io:30542/
- http://challenges.ctfd.io:30541/
- http://challenges.ctfd.io:30543/

This could be accomplished using a web proxy tool such as OWASP ZAP or Burp Suite or your favorite scripting language. It's up to you how you retrieve the flags. **Please, no automated scanners or denial of service. Be nice to the application!**  This is an exercise in **precision**.

If you would like to run the application locally, inside you'll find a README which instructs you on how to run the application. A pre-built WAR has been provided. The app was created and tested in the following environment:

Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
Release:	20.04
openjdk 14.0.2 2020-07-14
OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 14.0.2+12-Ubuntu-120.04)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 14.0.2+12-Ubuntu-120.04, mixed mode, sharing)

When in doubt, read the Spring framework docs!

Note: The flags in the provided source code have been changed in the live app.
