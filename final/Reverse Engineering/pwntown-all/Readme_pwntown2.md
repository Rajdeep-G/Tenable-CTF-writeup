I've been trying to make a video game. It's pretty rough around the edges right now. Character sprites don't always cooperate, one of the character classes can't even attack yet, but I'm pretty proud of it so far. I made it using Unity, a starter package called uMMORPG, and a bunch of assets from the public domain.

It's really difficult, but I'm sure a hacker such as yourself won't have any problem figuring it out. ;)

The flag for this challenge can be obtained by getting onto the secret island.


Hint:
What you see isn't always the same thing the server sees. How can we force the two to sync up?

Hint
There are a number of different ways to solve this challenge. One of the easiest ways to sync server-side position values and client-side values is to force a respawn. This solution, however, isn't the most obvious, but it's definitely the easiest.
