I've been trying to make a video game. It's pretty rough around the edges right now. Character sprites don't always cooperate, one of the character classes can't even attack yet, but I'm pretty proud of it so far. I made it using Unity, a starter package called uMMORPG, and a bunch of assets from the public domain.

It's really difficult, but I'm sure a hacker such as yourself won't have any problem figuring it out. ;)

The flag for this challenge can be obtained by completing Questy McQuestgiver's quest.

hint:
Questy McQuestgiver is too wise to fall for your tricks. Did you think you could just lie to him? Did you think you could just take the scroll without actually killing all those saplings? Think again. That said... he did spill the beans on what the prize is... I wonder if there's another way to obtain it?
