The first thing that caught my eye was the subject line.

>FWD: FWD: RE: FWD:  FWD: RE: FWD: FWD:  FWD: RE:  RE: RE: FWD: { FWD: FWD:  FWD: FWD: RE: RE: FWD: RE:  RE: RE:  FWD: FWD:  FWD: FWD: FWD:  FWD: FWD: FWD:  FWD: FWD: RE: RE: FWD: RE:  FWD: RE:  RE: RE: RE:  FWD: RE: FWD: FWD: }

 So, now the idea that might come to mind is something related to binary with 0 and 1. But it isn't so. 

 Take FWD as `.` and RE as `-`

and keep in mind about the spaces in between. (each `  ` double space should be noticed.)   

So you have 

`..-. .-.. .- --.{.. ..--.- -- .. ... ... ..--.- .- --- .-..}`

Now you can use a morse decoder.
